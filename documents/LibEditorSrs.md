# Software Requirements Specification for LirEditor

### Prepared by Novitski Valery

# Introduction
## Purpose

The purpose of the LirEditor Software Requirements Specification is to provide a clear and consistent vision of the LirEditor and to list all the software requirements for it.

This document is intended to ensure a common understanding of the software goals and tasks both by client and developers. 

The document is to be continuously updated to reflect the functionality changes that happen during the implementation of the Audit Ordering System Project, so that an accurate vision of what's been done is available at any time.
